## Computer Programming semester III exercise II
In this exercise I made a template to create and initialise a vector.
With that template I could:
* create a lambda function for the CreateVector template that initialises the created vector with successive powers of 2,
* create a lambda function for the CreateVector template that initialises the created vector with successive Fibonacci sequence numbers,
* write a function that removes the largest and smallest element from the vector,
* write a function, for a vector of integers, that returns the number of even elements,
* write a function that removes all multiples of elements from a vector,
* write a function that will remove all negative elements from a vector,
* write a function, for a vector of integers, that will remove all even elements,
* write a function that overwrites the values of all elements with a value greater than the set value (as a parameter) with this value. Similarly, the function is to overwrite all elements smaller with another value given as a parameter.
