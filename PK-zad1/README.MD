## Computer Programming semester III exercise I
In this exercise I created my own object-oriented implementation of a vector that can store elements of any type via a template.                 
The class implements the following methods:
* A parametric constructor which takes one parameter, 
* A parametric constructor that takes two parameter,
* A copy constructor,
* A transfer constructor,
* An assignment operator,
* A transfer operator,
* Comparison operators (== and !=),
* An index operator ([]),
* A method that inserts a new element at the end of the vector.
